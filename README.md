# Spotify-project
## Brief Overview
This is a personal project for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualisations created in Jupyter Notebooks using the data from my personal Spotify account.

## Data and processing
Data was provided by Spotify after an official request in April 2024. All initial files provided by Spotify came in JSON format, so in order to have a clearer idea of what is inside the data one main file with my account's music streaming history was converted to XSLX format. It was then quickly assessed and cleaned inside Google Sheets. After that the file's data was loaded in a Jupyter Notebook where it went through several steps of processing and visualisation using pandas, matplotlib, numpy and seaborn Python Libraries.

## Results
The clean Jupyter Notebook and the used data without PII was added to this github repository.

## Future ideas
Using the same data to create detailed visualisations using Tableau and posting it in Tableau Public.

## Inspiration
The project was inspired by a Women in Data Science (WiDS) Workshop on using Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and visualisations for Spotify data. I used the initial Jupyter Notebook from the link as an initial template to work with my own data but built on top of it in terms of visualisations features, metrics used and general analysis.
